## Brief summary of the data provided
  Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaurant near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaurant? Would you accept the 
  coupon but use it on a subsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaurant? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor 
   passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?
   Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to 
   them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?
